So for example, if a problem asks you to compute the average age of people in a dataset, you should be writing Python code in this notebook to do the computation instead of plugging it into some calculator and saving the hard-coded answer in the variable. In other words, we should be able to run your code on a smaller/larger dataset and get correct answers for those datasets with your code.\n",
