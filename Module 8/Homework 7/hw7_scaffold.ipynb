We have tried our best to remove some of the negative content but can only do so much when there are over 100k tweets in our dataset.This assignment should be doable without having to dig into the tweets present and reading about content you don't want to, but we wanted to give you a heads up just in case you do see something you find offensive.*\n",

                "This week, we will use the techniques for recommender systems in an unexpected way to help us model topics found on Twitter. In this homework you will practice extracting topics from tweets using matrix factorization. This method assumes every tweet is a combination of several topics weighted by their prevailance in the text. This approach in fact finds a low-dimensional representation of the tweets (through the topic weights).\n",

                "For this assignment, we will be working with tweets about the pandemic from over two years ago when the pandemic recently entered our lives. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets-late-april?select=2020-04-30+Coronavirus+Tweets.CSV) and the preprocessing we have done followed the steps [here](https://www.kaggle.com/satanizer/covid-19-tweets-analysis). For computational speed we will analyze a dataset from one day: April 30, 2020. We encourage you to explore this dataset further and see how topics change over time.\n",
